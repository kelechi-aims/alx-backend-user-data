**By**: Emmanuel Turlay, Staff Software Engineer at Cruise

**Weight**: 1

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing back-end authentication features, including handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII), implementing a log filter for obfuscating PII fields, encrypting passwords, and authenticating to a database using environment variables.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:
- Examples of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
- Implementation of a log filter to obfuscate PII fields
- Encryption of passwords and validation of input passwords
- Authentication to a database using environment variables
